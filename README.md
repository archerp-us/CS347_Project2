## Additional Comments
Overall, many aspects of the project are present just not fully complete. We ran into some issues throughout the process of completing the project that were not able to be resolved on time. Also, several outside factors limited development time that was able to be put into the project. All this to say that while the project does not meet every expectation, the pieces are in place to complete the implementation.
